# A Week #9

uhhhhh.... huh?

# School

So some shit happened, which is why I didn't write for like 2-3 weeks. It's been hectic, and I've been a mess.

My advisor is leaving not only the University of Waterloo, but also academia because the company he helped to found got acquired. So that means I'm advisor-less and left to figure out my situation. Staying at the university and finding a new advisor was certainly an option, but every professor I reached out to (or had my advisor reach out to) was unable to take on a student, so that sucked. For that reason I don't think I'll be staying at Waterloo for my PhD. It's really sad. I was so excited to be hear and so ready to dedicate myself to 4-5 years of quantum information, and now I'm tossed to the wayside. This is not only unfortunate because I can't find a new advisor at Waterloo, but because now I have to re-decide what to do with my life. I'm _so_ easily overwhelmed by decision making, especially decisions I deem important. Deciding to come to Waterloo was a big one because I applied to something like 13 schools, and then had to decide between 4 or so. Doing this all over again is _not_ something I'm looking forward to.

For the time being it looks like I'll switch to doing a masters, wrap that up as soon as possible, and move on. What "move on" looks like I still have no idea. I have a few options, one being applying for more PhD programs and the other being going back to Overleaf. Going back to Overleaf is definitely a very good option. People there like me, the work is mostly rewarding, and I get to learn a ton of new stuff all the time. Anyway, I don't need to think about it too much for the time being. I just need to finish my masters for now.

The semester also ended for me last week. Open Quantum Systems ended with the opposite of a bang: no exam, no project, no nothing. That was actually perfect given all the shit above I was dealing with. For Lie theory we had a 5-day take home exam that was actually pretty interesting and I think I learned a lot from. We'll see how I did, but as long as I got a 70+ in the course I'm happy.

# Work

Barely been working much recently because finals, but we had a "retreat" this week. It's our second virtual one, which just doesn't hit the same way in person ones do. Like people are still working. WTF is up with that?
